# ChatGPT Interface Clone

Welcome to the ChatGPT Interface Clone project! This is a Github repository where you can find the source code for a web-based interface that uses JavaScript to simulate a chatbot experience. This project is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and includes a few hardcoded responses to user inputs.

In this interface, users can interact with the chatbot by typing messages into a text field and receiving responses from the bot. The interface also includes several interactive features, such as a joke generator and a trivia quiz. The goal of this project is to provide an engaging and fun experience for users while showcasing the power and versatility of JavaScript.
